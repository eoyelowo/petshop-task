## Run Via Docker

Simply run the **make** command

```bash
make
```

The **make** command runs the following automatically, this means that the
**make** command is sufficient to run all of the commands below on the fly

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
docker compose exec app composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
docker compose exec app cp .env.example .env
docker compose exec app cp .env.testing.example .env.testing
docker compose exec app php artisan config:clear
docker compose exec app php artisan config:cache
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
docker compose exec app php artisan storage:link
docker compose exec app chmod -R 777 storage bootstrap/cache
```

#### localhost.

http://localhost:8000 will be available to access the app.

## Access Mysql

To access the mysql command line on docker, run the command below.

```bash
    make access-mysql-app
```

You can then run any mysql commands there. e.g.

```bash
    mysql -u root
```

1. Please, Ensure you have a database created for the local database and the test database.
   e.g. **buckhill_petshop_db** for local db and **buckhill_petshop_test_db** for test db.
    This is to prevent the test cases from making use of our local databases.
```bash
create database buckhill_petshop_db;
```

```bash
create database buckhill_petshop_test_db;
```

You can exit the **mysql** bash using the command below

```bash
exit;
```

    make fresh
```

The above command runs the command below under the hood.

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
